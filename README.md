# hundred-days-of-code
A repository dedicated to the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and the projects I complete as a part of it. 

Day 1: ToDo App (Pt. 1)
This is a basic to-do list web application built with Python & Flask. Upon completion it should allow users to add & remove items to their todo list.
  Today's Accomplishments:
    Setup venv
    Installed dependencies
    Setup a basic index page route
    Created the logic to add todo items to the todo list via the user-facing form
    Attempted to add item removal functionality
    Added form validation

  For tomorrow:
    Finish troubleshooting item removal implementation
    Add styling via Tailwind CSS
